# VC POS Alpha - GitHub Actions APK Build Guide

## 🚀 **Automated APK Building with GitHub Actions**

Your VC POS application now has a **fully automated APK build system** using GitHub Actions! This is perfect for your Termux setup since you don't need a local development environment.

## 📋 **How to Build Your APK**

### **Method 1: Manual Build (Recommended for Testing)**

1. **Go to GitHub Actions**
   - Visit: https://github.com/aseelsh24/vc_pos/actions
   - Click on "Android CI & APK Build" workflow

2. **Trigger Manual Build**
   - Click "Run workflow" button
   - Select build type:
     - **Debug**: For testing and development
     - **Release**: For production-ready APK
     - **Both**: Build both debug and release APKs
   - Click "Run workflow"

3. **Wait for Build**
   - Build takes 5-10 minutes
   - Watch real-time progress
   - See detailed logs and errors

### **Method 2: Automatic Build**

**On Every Push to Main/Feature Branches:**
- Push to `main` branch → Builds debug APK automatically
- Push to `feat/**` branches → Builds debug APK automatically

**On GitHub Release:**
- Create a new release → Builds release APK automatically

## 📱 **Download Your APK**

After build completion, download your APK from:

### **Debug APK (for testing):**
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Click on your completed workflow run
3. Scroll down to "Artifacts" section
4. Click "vc_pos-debug-apk" to download

### **Release APK (for distribution):**
1. Go to Actions tab  
2. Click on your completed workflow run
3. Scroll down to "Artifacts" section
4. Click "vc_pos-release-unsigned-apk" to download

### **Beta Release (automatic):**
