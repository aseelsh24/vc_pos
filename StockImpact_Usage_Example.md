### 5. Transaction Detail Dialog

## Usage Example

### Creating a Transaction with Stock Impact

```kotlin
// Example: Successful stock deduction
val successfulStockImpact = StockImpact(
    status = StockImpactStatus.STOCK_DEDUCTED,
    itemsDeducted = mapOf(
        1L to 5,  // Product ID 1, quantity 5
        2L to 3   // Product ID 2, quantity 3
    ),
    itemsFailed = emptyMap(),
    totalItemsAffected = 8
)

// Example: Failed stock deduction
val failedStockImpact = StockImpact(
    status = StockImpactStatus.STOCK_FAILED,
    itemsDeducted = mapOf(1L to 2),
    itemsFailed = mapOf(2L to 3),
    totalItemsAffected = 5
)

// Create transaction with stock impact
val transaction = Transaction(
    // ... other fields
    stockImpactJson = Transaction.serializeStockImpact(successfulStockImpact)
)
```

### Filtering Transactions

```kotlin
// Filter by successful stock deduction
viewModel.updateStockImpactFilter(StockImpactStatus.STOCK_DEDUCTED)

// Filter by failed stock deduction
viewModel.updateStockImpactFilter(StockImpactStatus.STOCK_FAILED)

// Clear filter to show all transactions
viewModel.updateStockImpactFilter(null)
```

### Searching Transactions

```kotlin
// Search by transaction ID, cashier name, or product name
viewModel.updateSearchQuery("123")
viewModel.updateSearchQuery("Ahmed")
viewModel.updateSearchQuery("Coca Cola")
```

## Visual Elements

### Stock Impact Icons

### Color Coding
